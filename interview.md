# Question to answer:
### Biggest Success you did:
In work, there is a lot. 
1.  In project level, I start the machine learning project within the team. It bring new responsibility
to our team and transformed the way we work.
2.  In team level, I trained few guys in China from rockie to expert in LTE. We are friends and I believe
we will still be friends even after I leave Qualcomm
3.  In my live, I hiked the grand canyon rim to rim, 24 miles in one day. That's the greatest project I
ever done.

### What didn't go well about the project? 
1.  First, design a wireless system is not our responsibility. There is more than 100s PhD in Qualcomm
is doing that, they are the expert in wireless communication. Their design is built on math modules like 
entropy, SVD and etc. So, design an wireless system based on machine learning is quite not comfortable 
for them, because you can't prove it. So, lots of idea been rejected. 
2.  If I have another chance, I could talked with people first, make sure the key person is support this
or interested in this project first. Then we can think about go to board auditant, present the easiest
idea first, provide 10 times more data to prove the algorithm.

### 问我团队之间有矛盾怎么办?
Yeah, I am currently in this situation and struggling to do sth. The background is our team is the 4G team
and there is another non-4G team which includes 3G, 2G team. Both team wanted to do 5G, so our manger is fighting
now. 
Here is what I did:
1.  Present myself, show my ability in tech. Let the other team think I am only defence myself in technology point of view.
==> The target for this is to gain the trust, I believe the start point of collaboration is Trust. If you trust me that 
I am just focus on issues or technology stuff, no personal, no political that is the great. 
2.  Ask if sth I can enhance, if the other team feel I am wrong in some way, I would like to talk. I think this is great 
chance to enhance myself.

###  假设你进了一个新组，你怎么样去提高组里product和工作?
To be honestly, I believe the first step is to let people trust you. Be stable as much as possible, keep my promise, 
sent my update in time. 
After that, if everyone trust me and I get familiar with the daily task. I will think about how to enhance. From what I 
understand, sth not optimal didn't mean it needed to be replaced, for example the keyboard.
I will try to develop some scrips simple to use and I do feel it is helpful for me. Then I will invite someone in our team 
to use it.
For example, In our team, we used to be like analysis failure one by one. But since our test team is expand like 5 times more, 
my manger and I started the project to automatic process logs and provide some initial analysis.
Another example is like, we proposed lots of changes but frequently get deny due to the system team think there is some 
special configuration could get harmed. So, we developed the LTE database to collect all those information. Then publish
it. 

### Why Microsoft?
First of all, I need to move to SF or Bay Area due to family reason. So, I have to select a good company for the next 3 - 4 years.
Secondly, I have few friends work in MS. They are really happy to be inside of the MS families. 
Thirdly, I am really interested in machine learning. Although we did some in Qualcomm, but I could like to say it is fake
machine learning. Because, the modem's compute power is way low compare to the PC, not even mention the data center. Like 
I did lots of modules but it can't be implemented because it consume too much power and battery is another concern. I looked 
Lobe's webpage, it really awesome. I like to learn all this things. 
The last but no least is the small team, in my mind, I like work for start up company but due to our visa issue, it's better 
to goes to bigger company for green card. Right now, Lobe joined MS. I can work in an start up environment and wtihout visa
issues. That's awesome. 

### Most favourite Microsoft product?


### What is the difference between good code and great code?
In my option, the good code is
1.  Correct: provide expected input shall output expected output; provide not expected input shall output False or similar output
2.  Time: running time of the code shall be within reasonable time
6.  Follows conventions

The additional things great code bring in includes:
1.  Consider the system/service: like the time is required to be very stable, no varies; like the space of system is small.
3.  Readable: mostly self explain, with necessary comment.
4.  Bundle with test.
5.  Well documented
4.  Is extensible
5.  Follow good design

# Question to ask:
### what's the work expectation here? How is that balance with life? How much did the team tend to work?

### How does the reward structure works? When people do good work, how does the company reward them?

### Team switch mechanism?
